#+title: Test

To complete the implementation, you'll need to:

Install the required backend packages:

pip install djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt django-cors-headers

Install axios in the frontend:

npm install axios

Update your other frontend components (like Layout.js) to include the Authorization header in API requests:

axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}`;

Implement logout functionality in your Layout component to clear tokens and user data.
Consider implementing more robust error handling and user feedback throughout your application.
